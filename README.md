Hey I'm Matt, alot of people know me online for having countless flannel shirts and long fluffy hair. When I'm not drinking tea, slapping desks and making magic, I work in events as a freelance technician, a fancy way of saying I can't keep a job and sometimes people hire me to do things.

I dabble in drinking tea, Qlab and playing with projectors, video wall and some broadcast and editing stuff I've worked on projects with local councils, and theatres around the North West of the UK, I occasionally appear at Fresh Nut Studios working with Dan "The Great" Bull and Stupendium, and sometimes I get spotted at gaming conventions donning some sort of flannel shirt and jeans pretending I know how to play cards games like hearthstone and streaming. 

My GitHub isn't here to rewrite the future, I looked into it and it seemed to long of a project, but more somewhat like a Shakespeare comic relief or a panto dame to keep the plot moving along and keep it light-hearted. You might not find much code here but you'll find some cool concepts and occasionally something you might go on to use in the future!
